# RPG II Spec Column Map

> **Who this is for:** anyone writing or reading RPG II source — whether
> hand-coding specs, debugging a column-alignment error, or building tooling
> that parses the fixed-column format. This is the go-to reference for "which
> columns mean what" across all four spec types.

Authoritative column positions for the RPG II fixed-format language.

All positions are **1-based, inclusive**. Column 6 always holds the form type
(`F`, `I`, `C`, `O`). Columns 1–5 are optional sequence; 60–74 comments; 75–80
program-id.

## C-spec (Calculation) — form type `C` in col 6

| Field                    | Cols    | Notes                                                    |
|--------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Control Level            | 7–8     | `L0`/`L1`–`L9`/`LR`/`SR`/`AN`/`OR`/blank                 |
| Conditioning Indicators  | **9–17**| 3 AND-groups, each `[N]II` (9–11, 12–14, 15–17)          |
| Factor 1                 | 18–27   | begins col 18                                            |
| Operation                | 28–32   | begins col 28                                            |
| Factor 2                 | 33–42   | begins col 33                                            |
| Result Field             | 43–48   | begins col 43 (alpha first)                              |
| Field Length             | 49–51   | 1–256 or blank                                           |
| Decimal Positions        | 52      | 0–9 or blank                                             |
| Half-Adjust              | 53      | `H` or blank                                             |
| Resulting Indicators     | **54–59**| HI/LO/EQ = 54–55/56–57/58–59 (2 chars each)             |
| Comments                 | 60–74   |                                                          |
| Program ID               | 75–80   |                                                          |

### Conditioning-indicator group format (cols 9–17)
Three 3-column groups, ANDed together:
```
col:  9 10 11 | 12 13 14 | 15 16 17
      [N] II  | [N] II   | [N] II
```
Col 9/12/15 = `N` (negation) or blank; 10–11/13–14/16–17 = 2-char indicator.

## F-spec (File Description) — form type `F` in col 6

| Field             | Cols    | Entry                                            |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Filename          | 7–14    | begins col 7 (alpha first)                       |
| File Type         | 15      | I / O / U / C                                    |
| File Designation  | 16      | P / S / F / C / R / T / D                        |
| End of File       | 17      | E (must reach EOF before program can end) / blank|
| Sequence          | 18      | A (ascending) / D (descending) / blank           |
| File Format       | 19      | F (fixed) common; also V/S/M/D/E                 |
| Record Length     | 24–27   | ends col 27                                      |
| Mode of Processing| 28      | blank / L (within limits) / R (random)           |
| Key Length        | 29–30   | length of the key / record-address field         |
| Record-Addr Type  | 31      | blank / A (zoned key) / I (RRN) / P (packed key) |
| Organization      | 32      | blank / I (indexed) / T (address-output)         |
| Overflow Indicator| 33–34   | OA–OG, OV                                        |
| Key Start         | 35–38   | 1-based record position of the key field         |
| Extension Code    | 39      | E / L                                            |
| Device            | 40–46   | DISK / WORKSTN / PRINTER / SPECIAL / ...         |
| File Condition    | 71–72   | blank / U1–U8 (external indicator)               |

`DISK`, `PRINTER`, and `WORKSTN` devices are implemented; `SPECIAL`/`CONSOLE`
are a hard compile error (E8). Designation `R` (record-address files) is parsed
into `FileDesign::RecordAddr` but has no codegen support and is also a hard
compile error (E5) rather than a silently-inert F-spec entry.

**WORKSTN continuation options** (manual "Continuation-Line Options for
WORKSTN File"): a second physical F-spec line, blank filename, keyword in
cols 54–59, value in cols 60–65 (60–67 for `FMTS`). `NUM` (max attachable
devices, default 1), `SAVDS`/`IND` (parsed, not implemented — no MRT/data-area
swapping, SRT only), `SLN` (parsed, not implemented — no variable start
line), `FMTS` (the `.dspf` display-format file name, default program-id +
`FM`), `ID` (2-char field that always holds the last-responding device),
`INFSR` (parsed, not implemented — no exception/error subroutine dispatch),
`INFDS` (the file-information DS name, see the I-spec section below),
`CFILE` (parsed, inert — ICF/telecommunications is a non-goal).

## I-spec (Input) — form type `I` in col 6

Record-identification line and field-description line share col 6. Field line:
| Field             | Cols    | Notes                            |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| Packed/Binary     | 43      | P / B / blank                    |
| Field From        | 44–47   | beginning record position        |
| Field To          | 48–51   | ending record position           |
| Decimal Positions | 52      | 0–9 numeric; blank = alphameric  |
| Field Name        | 53–58   | begins col 53 (alpha first)      |
| Control Level     | 59–60   | L1–L9                            |
| Matching Fields   | 61–62   | M1–M9                            |
| Field Indicators  | 65–70   | 65–66 plus, 67–68 minus, 69–70 zero |

**WORKSTN record identification** reuses this same mechanism unchanged: the
manual's own worked example (Figure 59) identifies a WORKSTN record's type by
an ordinary record-identification code (cols 21–41) matched against a byte
the *display format* embeds (a D-spec literal at a fixed buffer position) —
not a separate "which format was read" lookup. No new I-spec matching code
was needed for WORKSTN.

**INFDS keyword subfields** (a DS whose name matches an F-spec `INFDS`
value): a subfield line's cols 44–51 hold a keyword (`*STATUS` 5-digit
numeric, `*OPCODE` 5-char alphameric, `*RECORD` 8-char alphameric — the
format name, WRITE only, `*SIZE` 4-digit numeric, `*MODE`/`*INP`/`*OUT`
2-digit numeric) instead of a numeric From position; cols 53–58 still hold
the subfield name. Byte offsets are auto-assigned sequentially within the DS
(there is no real predefined System/36 layout to match — INFDS storage here
is entirely runtime-backed, not a byte-for-byte port). An ordinary DS may
still mix in explicit numeric-position subfields alongside keyword ones.

## O-spec (Output) — form type `O` in col 6

Two line types per file: a **record line** followed by **field lines**.

**Record line** (distinguished by a non-blank Type in col 15):
| Field                    | Cols    | Notes                                              |
|--------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Filename                 | 7–14    | first record line per file; may be omitted later   |
| AND/OR continuation      | 14–16   | `AND`/`OR` on a separate line, no Type of its own; extends/adds an OR-of-AND conditioning group (F1) |
| Type                     | 15      | **H** / **D** / **T** / **E** (Heading/Detail/Total/Exception) |
| Fetch Overflow / Release | 16      | `F` = poll this file's overflow latch immediately after this line (F2); `R` = release a WORKSTN/ICF device (hard error, unsupported); mutually exclusive with the ADD/DEL/UPDATE mnemonic below |
| Record Op (disk)         | 16–18   | `ADD`/`DEL`/`UPDATE` (G25); takes precedence over col 16 F/R when it matches |
| Space Before             | 17      | 0–3 lines                                          |
| Space After              | 18      | 0–3; all-blank 17–22 ⇒ single-space after          |
| Skip Before              | 19–20   | line number 01–99 / A0–B2                          |
| Skip After               | 21–22   | line number                                        |
| Record Conditioning Inds | 23–31   | 3 groups `[N]II` (23–25 / 26–28 / 29–31); AND/OR continuation lines add more groups/indicators (F1) |
| EXCPT name               | 32–37   | type E only                                        |

**Field line** (cols 7–31 blank):
| Field                | Cols    | Notes                                            |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Field Conditioning   | 23–31   | per-field indicators                             |
| Field Name           | 32–37   | field name, or blank if a constant follows       |
| Edit Code            | 38      | leading-zero / sign / punctuation control        |
| Blank After          | 39      | `B` resets field to blanks/zeros after output    |
| End Position         | 40–43   | rightmost output position (right-justified); blank = pack after previous |
| Packed/Binary        | 44      | Not implemented (P/B disk-output encoding, manual 88929-88950); not parsed at all, left as an explicit gap (see the "Section C additions" note below) |
| Constant/Edit Word   | 45–70   | quoted `'...'` constant (field name cols blank)  |

**WORKSTN format-name field line**: `Kn` (n = format-name length) in cols
40–43 instead of a numeric end position, and the quoted display-format name
in cols 45–54 (field name cols 32–37 blank). One is required per WORKSTN
output record line and it cannot be conditioned by any indicators. Every
other field line under the same record places its value by ordinary byte
position (cols 40–43), same as PRINTER/DISK output — WORKSTN field
placement is byte-offset based, not row/column (row/column belong to the
*display format*, see "Section O additions" below).

Type timing: **H** prints at heading time (headings with 1P print once at
start); **D** prints once per record at detail time; **T** prints at total time
(control breaks and LR). Phase 7 implements D and T; H is deferred.

## Operation semantics (Phase 2–6 subset)

Numeric comparisons (`COMP`, `IFxx`, `DOWxx`, `DOUxx`, `CASxx`) align factor 1
and factor 2 at their implied decimal point before comparing: if the two
operands have different decimal-position counts, the one with fewer decimals
is scaled up to match the other before the `icmp`, so e.g. a 2-decimal field
holding 1.50 correctly compares less than a 0-decimal field holding 2 (rather
than a raw-storage compare of 150 vs. 2).

**Phase 9 additions.** Alphanumeric fields (I-spec col 52 blank) compile to
`[N x i8]` globals; `MOVE`/`MOVEL` do right/left-justified byte copies; quoted
literals `'...'` work as character operands. E-spec numeric arrays (cols 27-32
name, 36-39 count, 40-42 entry length, 44 decimals) support compile-time data
(after the source, introduced by `** ` records) and run-time initialisation;
element access uses `ARRAY,INDEX` (1-based) in any factor/result field. `XFOOT`
sums an array; `SQRT` computes a half-adjusted square root.

**Phase 10 additions.** Alphanumeric `COMP` compares two character operands
(left-aligned, blank-padded) via the runtime, setting HI/LO/EQ. `LOKUP` searches
a numeric array for factor1, setting HI/LO/EQ indicators and updating a
variable index on a match. `MOVEA` does a left-justified byte move between
character operands (field↔field, array↔field). O-spec numeric fields accept an
**edit code** (col 38) applied via the runtime formatter, per Table 8 of the
manual (62103-62330): the code is one of four letter groups differing only in
sign style — `1`-`4` print no sign, `A`-`D` print a trailing `CR`, `J`-`M`
print a trailing minus, `N`-`Q` print a leading sign — and within each group
of four, the four codes vary independently by comma/decimal-point punctuation
(the first two of each four get commas and a forced decimal point; the last
two get neither unless the field has decimal positions) and by zero-balance
behavior (the 2nd and 4th code of each four blank out an exactly-zero value
instead of printing `.00`/`0`). So `1`/`A`/`J`/`N` and `2`/`B`/`K`/`O` are
comma+decimal, with the second of each pair also zero-blanking; `3`/`C`/`L`/`P`
and `4`/`D`/`M`/`Q` are plain digits, with the second of each pair also
zero-blanking.

Subroutines sit after all detail/total calcs. Each compiles to a separate
LLVM function sharing the program's globals (fields, indicators). `EXSR`
calls it; `ENDSR` returns to the caller. No recursion; no GOTO across the
subroutine boundary.

**Section B additions — tables, prerun-time, alternating arrays.** An E-spec
name beginning with `TAB` (case-insensitive) is a *table* rather than an
array; tables have no explicit indexing and instead carry a hidden 1-based
current-element shadow (`rpgs_<name>`, default 1). `LOKUP` of a bare table
name advances the shadow to the matched element, and a *related* table named
in the result field advances in lockstep (its corresponding element becomes
current). A bare table name in any factor/result field resolves to the
shadow-selected element; the explicit `TABLE,INDEX` form still works as an
ordinary array ref. **Prerun-time** arrays/tables (cols 11–18 filename) are
loaded once at the top of `main` via the `rpg_rt_load_arrays` runtime helper,
before the cycle or calc chain runs. Prerun-time numeric data defaults to
zoned-decimal ASCII; col 43 (blank/`P`/`B`) selects packed-decimal or binary
instead, decoded via `rpg_rt_get_packed`/`rpg_rt_get_binary` the same as an
ordinary I-spec field. **Alternating** arrays/tables (cols 46–57: 46–51
partner name, 52–54 entry length, 55 packed/binary format (mirrors col 43),
56 decimals, 57 sequence) are parsed and emitted as their own global; their
compile-time and prerun-time data interleave on each record (A1 B1 A2 B2 …).

**Section C additions — the numeric data model.** Every numeric field is stored
as a single signed `i32` that is a *scaled integer*: the stored value equals the
true value × 10^decimals, where `decimals` is the field's decimal-position count
(I-spec col 52, or C-spec col 52 for an inline-defined result). Arithmetic
honors this scale: ADD/SUB align operands to `max(dec1,dec2)` before computing;
MULT's result scale is `dec1+dec2`; DIV scales the numerator up to retain
precision, then all ops adjust to the result field's scale. **Half-adjust**
(C-spec col 53 = `H`) rounds by adding 5 at the first dropped digit before
truncating; it applies to ADD/SUB/MULT/DIV (and SQRT, which is always
half-adjusted). `Z-ADD`/`Z-SUB` rescale factor 2 to the result's decimals.

I-spec **col 43** selects the input field's byte encoding: blank = zoned
(ASCII digits, the default), `P` = packed-decimal (two BCD digits per byte, sign
nibble F=+/D=− in the low-order byte), `B` = binary (big-endian; 2-byte int16
or 4-byte int32). Packed and binary fields are decoded at read time by
`rpg_rt_get_packed` / `rpg_rt_get_binary` into the same scaled-integer
representation. O-spec col 44 (the output-side packed-decimal/binary
equivalent, DISK/ICF only) is not parsed at all -- an explicit, documented
gap rather than a parsed-but-inert column (see the O-spec table above).

**Sign-overpunch** governs MOVE between alphameric and numeric operands
(Section C, C10): the last digit of the character string carries the sign via
its zone — `A`–`I` = positive digits 1–9, `J`–`R` = negative digits 1–9, plain
`0`–`9` = positive. `rpg_rt_overpunch_in` decodes a character string to a signed
value (used by char→numeric MOVE); `rpg_rt_overpunch_out` encodes a value back
(numeric→char MOVE). Output formatting is decimal-aware via
`rpg_rt_line_put_num_dec` and `rpg_rt_edit_dec`, which emit the field's
fractional digits from the scaled integer.

**Section D additions — output spec gaps.** Heading (H) lines and any detail
line conditioned by the **1P** first-page indicator print once at program start,
before the cycle; 1P turns off afterward (it is a new reserved indicator index).
**Skip-before/skip-after** (O-spec cols 19–20 / 21–22) advance the output to an
absolute page line via `rpg_rt_skip`; a skip to a line at or before the current
position starts a new page (form-feed, page counter incremented). The
**PAGE** / **PAGE1**–**PAGE7** reserved output field names print a per-file page
counter (page 1 on the first page) via `rpg_rt_page`. **Per-field conditioning
indicators** (O-spec field-line cols 23–31) gate individual fields on a line —
a field whose conditions don't hold is omitted while the rest print. **Edit
words** (cols 45–70, quoted, with col 38 blank) format a numeric field via
`rpg_rt_edit_word`: blanks are replaceable (filled by source digits
right-aligned), the first `0` stops zero-suppression, the first `*` does
check-protection, a trailing `-` or `CR` is a sign (printed only if negative),
and `&` forces a literal blank.

**Section E additions — input spec gaps.** A primary file may contain multiple
record types distinguished by **record-identification codes** (I-spec cols
21–41): three 7-column sets (position / Not / C-Z-D / character), with AND/OR
continuation lines. At read time each record type's codes are matched against
the record buffer; the matching type's record-identifying indicator (cols
19–20) turns on, and records matching no type are skipped. A field's
**field-record-relation** (cols 63–64) ties it to a record type so it is
extracted only when that indicator is on. **Field indicators** (cols 65–66 /
67–68 / 69–70) turn on at read time when a numeric field is positive / negative
/ zero (for an alphameric field, the 69–70 indicator fires on all-blank). A
`**` record-identification line marks **look-ahead fields**: the field lines
that follow are decoded from the *next* (uncommitted) record via
`rpg_rt_peek_next`, and fill with 9s at end-of-file.

**Section F additions — cycle & matching.** When a program declares a **primary
file plus one or more secondary files** (F-spec designation `S`), it is compiled
to a separate multifile cycle rather than the single-file cycle. Each input
file's current record is held in its own buffer (`rpg_rec_<file>`, with a `got_`
valid flag); each cycle selects one record to process. An input field tagged
**M1** (I-spec cols 61–62) is a match field — files carrying M1 are merged in
ascending key order (ties keep the higher-priority file, primary first), and the
**MR** indicator turns on when the selected record's M1 equals another held
record's M1. Files *without* an M1 are processed by priority (primary fully,
then secondaries in F-spec order). The selected record is copied into the shared
`rpg_rec` and only that file's fields are decoded, so the rest of the cycle
(total/detail calc and output) is identical to the single-file path. Only a
single numeric M1 field is supported; combined M1–M9 keys and alphameric match
fields are future work.

**Overflow** (F22): a PRINTER file may carry an overflow indicator in **F-spec
cols 33–34** (`OA`–`OG` or `OV`). The overflow line is taken from a line-counter
**L-spec** (form type `L`: cols 7–14 filename, 15–17 lines per page, 20–22
overflow line), defaulting to six lines from the bottom of a 66-line page. The
runtime latches overflow when printed output reaches the overflow line; after
total output each cycle the compiler polls the latch (`rpg_rt_take_overflow`),
turns the overflow indicator on, runs the overflow-conditioned Heading/Detail/
Total output, and turns the indicator off. (Indicator-driven; automatic form-
feed advance without an assigned indicator is future work.)

**Section G additions — file handling.** `CHAIN`/`SETLL`/`READE`/`READ` provide
keyed and positioned access to DISK files (C-specs). An indexed file declares
its key on the F-spec (cols 29–30 length, 35–38 start); the runtime builds an
in-memory key→offset index on first use, and `CHAIN` binary-searches it (or,
with no key, reads by relative-record number). `SETLL` positions at the lower
bound; `READ`/`READE` advance sequentially (`READE` only while the key matches).
The no-record indicator is cols 54–55; EOF/unequal is cols 58–59.

**Update files** (F-spec type `U`, G25) open `r+` for in-place rewrite. The
record operation is driven by the **O-spec**: `ADD` in cols 16–18 appends,
type `U` in col 15 (or `UPDATE` semantics) rewrites the last-read record, and
`DEL` in cols 16–18 marks it deleted (filled with 0xFF). ADD (cycle append)
and CHAIN-based UPDATE are exercised by the tests.

Control levels (L1–L9) are assigned to input fields on the **I-spec, cols
59–60**. The cycle detects a break when a control field's value changes
between records; the broken level and all lower levels turn on (cascade:
L3 → L1, L2, L3). C-specs conditioned by `L1`..`L9` (cols 7–8) run at total
time when that level or higher is on; `L0` runs every total time; `LR` runs
at last record. At LR all of L1–L9 turn on, so the final group's subtotals
print. Total calcs/output run in ascending level order (L0, L1, …, L9, LR).
Per the manual's first-cycle rule, the first record establishes the control-
field baseline but does **not** cascade L1–L9 — totals (and hence breaks) are
bypassed until after the first record carrying control fields is processed
(Section F, F23).

`xx` for IF/DOW/DOU is one of `GT LT EQ NE GE LE` (compare F1 to F2).

Arithmetic rules: all of ADD/SUB/MULT/DIV let factor 1 be omitted (the result
field substitutes); factor 2 is always required. SUB = F1−F2, MULT = F1×F2,
DIV = F1(dividend)/F2(divisor) → quotient in result. MVR must immediately
follow a DIV and moves the remainder to its result field. Overflow is silent
truncation (max 15 digits, signed). Half-adjust (col 53 `H`) rounds the result
for ADD/SUB/MULT/DIV (not MVR, not DIV-then-MVR).

Structured-op rules: a single `END` operation closes IFxx, DOWxx, DOUxx, DO,
and CAS groups (there is no ENDIF/ENDDO in S/36 RPG II). `DOWxx` tests at the
top (body may run zero times); `DOUxx` tests at the bottom (body runs at least
once, exits when the condition becomes true). `DO` is a counted loop: it moves
factor 1 (start, default 1) into the index (result field; compiler-generated if
blank), runs the body while the index ≤ factor 2 (limit), and at END adds the
END's factor 2 (increment, default 1) to the index. `CASxx` opens a case group
(one or more CASxx ops then END); each CASxx compares F1/F2 and, if true, calls
the subroutine named in the result field — `CAS` with blank xx is an
unconditional default that runs like EXSR. Groups nest up to 100 deep. There is
no `ANDxx`/`ORxx` operation in this dialect — compound conditions use AN/OR
lines (cols 7–8) over indicators.

**Section A additions.** `Z-SUB` stores the negation of factor 2. `EXCPT` (with
an optional name in factor 2) writes type-E O-records at calculation time: a
named EXCPT writes only E-records whose cols 32–37 name matches; a blank
factor 2 writes only the unnamed E-records. The O-spec parser now carries the
filename forward across continuation record lines. `TESTZ` tests the "zone" of
the leftmost character of the (alphameric) result field — since this is an ASCII
compiler with no EBCDIC zone, the plus zone is the manual's explicit set `&`
and A–I (plus a–i as an ASCII extension), the minus zone is `-` and J–R (plus
j–r), and anything else is the zero zone. `TESTB` tests the bits named by factor
2 (a `'025'`-style bit-number literal where 0 is the leftmost bit, or the ON
bits of a 1-position character field) against the result field: HI if every
tested bit is off, LO if mixed, EQ if every tested bit is on.

**Section O additions — WORKSTN (display files).** The manual's own
SDA/S-D-spec display-format tooling has no equivalent in this project, so
display formats are authored as a separate `.dspf` text file (referenced by
the F-spec's `FMTS` continuation option, looked up next to the main source
the same way `/COPY` members are, D3), parsed by `compiler/src/sspec.cpp`
(format header) and `dspec.cpp` (field lines). A format is an **S-spec**
header line (col 6 `S`, name cols 7–14, function-key list cols 16–39,
command-key list cols 41–70, comma-separated) followed by **D-spec** field
lines (col 6 `D`): usage col 16 (`I`/`O`/`B`), screen row/column cols 18–19/
21–22, protect col 31, color col 33 (`B`/`R`/`G`/`W`/`T`/`Y`/`P`), reverse
col 35, blink col 37, buffer From/To cols 44–47/48–51 (same columns as an
ordinary I-spec field line), decimals col 52, field name cols 53–58 (blank
= a literal, quoted text from col 60). A field's buffer From/To is what the
I-spec (reading) and O-spec (writing, via the `Kn` format-name line above)
address — screen row/column only matters to the runtime backend's
rendering.

Two runtime backends implement the actual terminal, selected once via the
`RPG_WORKSTN_MODE` environment variable (`terminal` default, or
`headless`): **terminal** drives the real controlling tty with ANSI/VT100
cursor positioning and SGR color/reverse/blink, collecting input fields via
ordinary line-buffered prompts (not a raw single-keystroke editor — the part
most likely to need revision after real use); **headless** reads a
line-oriented script (`RPG_WORKSTN_SCRIPT`: `FORMAT`/`DEVICE`/`FIELD`/`KEY`
lines per simulated read, `KEY` triggering the read) and dumps each written
screen to `RPG_WORKSTN_DUMP` (default stdout) — what the regression suite
(`tests/workstn.rpg`, `tests/workstn_ops.rpg`) drives, since it runs
non-interactively. Both backends parse the same `.dspf` file independently
(a small duplicate parser in `runtime/rpg_runtime.c`, since the C runtime
doesn't link the compiler's C++ frontend).

A WORKSTN primary file drives the implicit cycle exactly like a DISK primary
(control levels, matching, total/detail ordering, LR handling are all
unchanged) except for the open (`rpg_rt_ws_open`+`rpg_rt_ws_acquire` instead
of `rpg_rt_open_input`) and the per-cycle read (`rpg_rt_ws_read` instead of
`rpg_rt_read_next`), which additionally resets then sets the `KA`-`KY`
function-key indicators, copies the responding device into the F-spec `ID`
field if declared, and updates INFDS. `ACQ`/`REL`/`NEXT`/`POST`/`SHTDN` are
ordinary calc-time operations against any opened WORKSTN file (primary,
ACQ-acquired secondary devices, or a demand file); `READ` and `EXCPT`/O-spec
output against a WORKSTN file share this same runtime path. Look-ahead
(`**`, E19) is not supported for a WORKSTN primary (hard error): there is no
"next record" to peek at ahead of an operator's input.

Explicitly out of scope: MRT (multiple requester terminal) programs —
only SRT (single requester terminal) is implemented, so `SAVDS`/`IND` data-
area/indicator swapping and `SUBR20`/`SUBR21`/`MRTMAX` are parsed-but-inert;
the INFSR exception/error-processing subroutine (an unhandled command-key
exception with no resulting indicator is simply not surfaced, rather than
the manual's "program halts"); DBCS; a variable start line (`SLN`); and a
real 5250 protocol (the terminal backend is a Linux tty standing in for the
display station, same porting-decision category as the DISK "record format"
note in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Indicators

- General: `01`–`99`
- Control level: `L0`–`L9` (`L0` always on at total time)
- Last record: `LR`
- Matching record: `MR` *(on when the selected record's M1 equals another held
  record's M1 in the multifile cycle; Section F)*
- Halt: `H1`–`H9`
- Overflow: `OA`–`OG`, `OV`  *(no `OF`/`ON` in SC09-1818); latched by the runtime
  when output reaches the overflow line, polled at total time, Section F)*
- External: `U1`–`U8`
- Function keys: `KA`–`KN`, `KP`–`KY` (`KO` reserved)
- First page: `1P` (output only, internal)

Internally each special is a dedicated `i1` global: `01`–`99` live in a single
`[100 x i1]` array (`@rpg_in`), and `LR`, `L1`–`L9`, `1P`, `MR`, `OA`–`OG`, `OV`
each get their own global. `H1`–`H9` and `U1`–`U8` are real backing globals
consulted by conditioning but have no producer that sets them (no HALT
operation, no external-indicator source). The function-key indicators
(`KA`–`KY`) are set by a WORKSTN read (Section O): reset to off, then the
one the operator pressed (if any) turned on.
